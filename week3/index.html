					<h2>DATA SCIENCE AND AI</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="ai.png">
					<br>
					<p>Data Analytics and Deep Learning are more than just buzzwords and are changing the world. It's because of AI that we predictive and prescriptive analytics manifested and we have optimized planning paradigms. Stock prediction, Autonomous Machines (and almost everything), Augmented/Intelligent Healthcare and Cognitive computer vision are just the begining.
				</div>
				<div class="topic">
					<h2>IOT</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="iot.png">
					<br>
					<p>Over 2 billion devices to be connected to the internet by the end of this year. Harnessing the power of AI and high performance edge computing enables us to set up and develop solutions for automation and intelligent optimization. Use cutting edge technologies reinvent homes, hospitals, wearables, industries, supply chain, agriculture, power systems and much more.

				<div class="topic">
					<h2>ROBOTICS</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="robotics.png">
					<br>
					<p>There was a time when we just started moving machines with Digital Signals. May it be the Driverless cars or the robots that perform complicated surgery. With power of High Performance Edge Computing, AI has transformed everything into 'Autonomous Everything'. At HackOff, explore and exhibit what you can make the robots do.

					<h2>BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="blockchain.png">
					<br>
					<p>Politics and transparency don't always go hand in hand when it comes down to it. Government entities have budgets and responsibilities that they need to fulfil given their citizens. At the moment, it's quite difficult to monitor everything that they do expense-wise and make sure that money is being spent ethically. The increased transparency provided by a decentralized ledger would also help increase overall integrity.
				</div>
				<div class="topic">
					<h2>AR AND VR</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="vr.png">
					<br>
					<p>The Augment Reality revolution will also have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. Use technology to create smart healthcare solutions for people residing in urban centres. A unified healthcare system, with collecting and sharing of data along with analysis and research practices, is what will determine the future of public healthcare.
				</div>

					<h2>OPEN INNOVATION</h2>
					<img class="topic_icon" src="open.png">
					<br>
					<p>We live in a time where Technologies have converged extensively and technological development has diverged beyond our listed domains. HackOff believes in going out of the box. Use your tech stack to reinvent hardware based sectors.
